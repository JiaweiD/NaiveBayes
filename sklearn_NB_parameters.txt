naive_bayes.BernoulliNB()
    alpha:      float, default=1.0
                It stands for the smooth factor. If alpha = 1, it means Laplace smooth.
    binarize:   float or None, default=0.0
                It stands for the threshold value of binarizing. If binarize = 0, it means all the features are binary values.
    fit_prior:  boolean, default=True
                It stands for whether to learn class prior probabilities or not.
    class_prior:array-like,shape[n_classes], default=None
                It stands for the prior probabilities of the classes. 
naive_bayes.GaussianNB()
    priors:     array-like,shape[n_classes], default=None
                It stands for prior probabilities of the classes. 
naive_bayes.MultinomialNB()
    alpha:      float, default=1.0
                It stands for the smooth factor. If alpha = 1, it means Laplace smooth.
    fit_prior:  boolean, default=True
                It stands for whether to learn class prior probabilities or not.
    class_prior:array-like,shape[n_classes], default=None
                It stands for the prior probabilities of the classes.
